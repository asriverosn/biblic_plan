    "jesus": "The Son, who is the Word of the Father, true and eternal God, of one substance with the Father, took on human nature in the womb of the blessed virgin, so that two natures, namely the Divine and the Human, were united in one person, never to be separated, resulting in one Christ, true God and true Man, who truly suffered, was crucified, died, and on the third day rose again to reconcile us with his Father, not only for original guilt but also for the actual sins of all men.",

    "holy_spirit": "The Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, is of the same substance, majesty, and glory as the Father and the Son, being a true and eternal God.
